# weather-app

This weather app was an assignment from the odin project. 

This project was my first experience with an Api.

Users of this app are able to enter a city of their choosing and will receive the current weather forecast. 

The weather forecast includes the current tempurature, the "feels like" tempurature and a short description of the weather.

Additionally there is a button which switches the tempurature readings from celsius to farenheit.
